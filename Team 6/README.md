#Our Experience 
We Selva Karthik, Sathish and Shreya worked as Teammates for our Club SALVO, 
focusing on data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Despite initial 
confusion due to the team's lack of basic knowledge in data analysis, they found 
it beneficial to learn together. They learned about various graphs, data cleaning techniques, 
and selecting appropriate datasets for their project through discussions via calls and chats. 
Ultimately, they successfully completed the project and are eager to collaborate on more projects in the future.
