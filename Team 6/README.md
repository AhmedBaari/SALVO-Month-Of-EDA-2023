We Selva Karthik, Sathish and Shreya worked as Teammates for our first Task, 
focusing on data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Despite initial 
confusion due to the team's lack of basic knowledge in data analysis, we found 
it beneficial to learn together. We learned about various graphs, data cleaning techniques, 
and selecting appropriate datasets for their project through discussions via calls and chats. 
Ultimately, We successfully completed the project and are eager to collaborate on more projects in the future.
